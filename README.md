## Motivation Behind Appl.io

As I am entering the job search for web developer position, I wanted to create something that would be easy to use in order to keep track of all of the application I will be sending out. Other alternatives tend to get complex and at times have too many customization options. Appl.io was a solution to this problem, a simple and intuitive way to track the status of your job applications. üëç
